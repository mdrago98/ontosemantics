0 	 Central diabetes insipidus is a rare disease of the hypothalamus and neurohypophysis.
1 	 It is very unusually found in the adult with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
2 	 It is manifested by a polydipsic polyuric syndrome, which must be distinguished from the poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus.
3 	 Given the similarity of both entities and the unusual nature of their coexistence, their suspicion is difficult.
4 	 The case of a 72-year-old male with type 2 diabetes mellitus with poor insulin control (fasting hyperglycemia greater than 180 mg/dl) who had a long-standing polyuric syndrome is here presented.
5 	 Hypernatremia and plasma osmolality elevated together with a low urinary osmolality led to the suspicion of diabetes insipidus, which was subsequently confirmed by the dehydration test and the administration of desmopressin sc.
6 	 With 61% increase in the calculated urinary osmolarity one hour post desmopressin s.c., diabetes insipidus of central type was diagnosed.
7 	 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance showed a bright spot with normal neurohypophysis, contributing to the diagnosis of the idiopathic form.
8 	 Pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis is an uncommon diffuse cystic lung disease in adults.
9 	 In rare cases, it can involve extrapulmonary organs and lead to endocrine abnormalities such as central diabetes insipidus.
10 	 A 42-year-old man presented with polyphagia and polydipsia, as well as a dry cough and dyspnea on exertion.
11 	 Magnetic resonance imaging of the hypothalamic-pituitary system failed to show the posterior pituitary, which is a typical finding in patients with central diabetes insipidus.
12 	 This condition was confirmed by a water deprivation test, and the patient was also found to have type 2 diabetes mellitus.
13 	 Computed tomographic scanning of the lungs revealed multiple, irregularly shaped cystic lesions and small nodules bilaterally, with sparing of the costophrenic angles.
14 	 Lung biopsy through video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery revealed pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis.
15 	 On a follow-up visit, only 1 year after the patient had quit smoking, clinical and radiological improvement was significant.
16 	 Here, we report an uncommon case of pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis that simultaneously presented with diabetes insipidus and diabetes mellitus.
17 	 To report a case of Wolfram syndrome (WS) characterized by diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, progressive optic atrophy, and deafness.
18 	 Under physiological conditions, fluid and electrolyte homoeostasis is maintained by the kidney adjusting urine volume and composition according to body needs.
19 	 Diabetes Insipidus is a complex and heterogeneous clinical syndrome affecting water balance and characterized by constant diuresis, resulting in large volumes of dilute urine.
20 	 With respect to the similarly named Diabetes Mellitus, a disease already known in ancient Egypt, Greece and Asia, Diabetes Insipidus has been described several thousand years later.
21 	 In 1670s Thomas Willis, noted the difference in taste of urine from polyuric subjects compared with healthy individuals and started the differentiation of Diabetes Mellitus from the more rare entity of Diabetes Insipidus.
22 	 In 1794, Johann Peter Frank described polyuric patients excreting nonsaccharine urine and introduced the term of Diabetes Insipidus.
23 	 An hystorical milestone was the in 1913, when Farini successfully used posterior pituitary extracts to treat Diabetes Insipidus.
24 	 Until 1920s the available evidence indicated Diabetes Insipidus as a disorder of the pituitary gland.
25 	 In the early 1928, De Lange first observed that some patients with Diabetes Insipidus did not respond to posterior pituitary extracts and subsequently Forssman and Waring in 1945 established that the kidney had a critical role for these forms of Diabetes Insipidus resistant to this treatment.
26 	 In 1947 Williams and Henry introduced the term Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus for the congenital syndrome characterized by polyuria and renal concentrating defect resistant to vasopressin.
27 	 In 1955, du Vigneaud received the 1955 Nobel Prize in chemistry for the first synthesis of the hormone vasopressin representing a milestone for the treatment of Central Diabetes Insipidus.
28 	 Clostridium ramosum is a generally non-pathogenic enteric anaerobe, and Fournier's gangrene is a rare necrotizing soft tissue infection with male predisposition affecting the perineum and the genital area.
29 	 We report, to our knowledge, the first case of Fournier's gangrene caused by C. ramosum in a female patient with multiple underlying conditions.
30 	 The combination of hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state and central diabetes insipidus is unusual and poses unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges for clinicians.
31 	 In a patient with diabetes mellitus presenting with polyuria and polydipsia, poor glycaemic control is usually the first aetiology that is considered, and achieving glycaemic control remains the first course of action.
32 	 However, severe hypernatraemia, hyperglycaemia and discordance between urine-specific gravity and urine osmolality suggest concurrent symptomatic diabetes insipidus.
33 	 We report a rare case of concurrent manifestation of hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state and central diabetes insipidus in a patient with a history of craniopharyngioma.
34 	 Diabetes insipidus, characterized by polyuria and polydipsia, is a rare disease during pregnancy.
35 	 Nevertheless, its recognition is important to avoid complications due to dehydration and hypernatremia.
36 	 Its manifestation during pregnancy ranges from exacerbation of pre-existing central or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus to transient pregnancy-induced diabetes insipidus due to the increased metabolism of the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin (AVP) by the placental vasopressinase.
37 	 Diagnosis can be challenging, as urinary frequency is common during pregnancy and primary polydipsia also needs to be excluded.
38 	 Also, the standard water deprivation test is not recommended during pregnancy due to the increased risk of complications.
39 	 Treatment depends upon the final diagnosis, with desmopressin (DDAVP) being the medication of choice in AVP-deficient diabetes insipidus, whereas nephrogenic diabetes insipidus requires treatment of the underlying disease and supportive measures.
40 	 The indirect water-deprivation test is the current reference standard for the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus.
41 	 However, it is technically cumbersome to administer, and the results are often inaccurate.
42 	 The current study compared the indirect water-deprivation test with direct detection of plasma copeptin, a precursor-derived surrogate of arginine vasopressin.
43 	 Neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus is characterized by polyuria and polydipsia owing to partial or complete deficiency of the antidiuretic hormone, arginine vasopressin (AVP).
44 	 Although in most patients non-hereditary causes underlie the disorder, genetic forms have long been recognized and studied both in vivo and in vitro.
45 	 In most affected families, the disease is transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner, whereas autosomal recessive forms are much less frequent.
46 	 Both phenotypes can be caused by mutations in the vasopressin-neurophysin II (AVP) gene.
47 	 In transfected cells expressing dominant mutations, the mutated hormone precursor is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it forms fibrillar aggregates.
48 	 Autopsy studies in humans and a murine knock-in model suggest that the dominant phenotype results from toxicity to vasopressinergic neurons, but the mechanisms leading to cell death remain unclear.
49 	 Recessive transmission results from AVP with reduced biologic activity or the deletion of the locus.
50 	 Genetic neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus occurring in the context of diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and deafness is termed DIDMOAD or Wolfram syndrome, a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the wolframin (WFS 1) gene.
51 	 Diabetes insipidus is a disease characterized by polyuria and polydipsia due to inadequate release of arginine vasopressin from the posterior pituitary gland (neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus) or due to arginine vasopressin insensitivity by the renal distal tubule, leading to a deficiency in tubular water reabsorption (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus).
52 	 This article reviews the genetics of diabetes insipidus in the context of its diagnosis, clinical presentation, and therapy.
53 	 We report a 27-year-old pregnant woman with polyuria, polydipsia and headache in the third trimester of pregnancy.
54 	 Hypernatremia (153 mEq/L), high plasma osmolality
55 	 (300 mOsm/kgH<sub>2</sub>O) and low urinary osmolality (92 mOsm/kgH<sub>2</sub>O) were observed at the admission to our hospital.
56 	 Plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) level was inappropriately low (2.2 pg/mL) compared to the high plasma osmolality.
57 	 Plasma AVP responses to hypertonic-saline infusion were blunted, and her urine osmolality increased in response to desmopressin.
58 	 The diagnosis of central diabetes insipidus was made from these results.
59 	 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of hypothalamic-pituitary region demonstrated a significant enlargement of the pituitary stalk, suggesting the presence of hypophysitis.
60 	 In addition, serum anti-rabphilin-3A antibodies that have been recently reported as a biomarker of lymphocytic infundibulo-neurohypophysitis, were positive.
61 	 Diabetes insipidus continued after delivery, suggesting that polyuria was not mainly due to excessive vasopressinase activity or reduced renal sensitivity to AVP by prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> that can cause temporal polyuria during pregnancy.
62 	 We therefore clinically diagnosed central diabetes insipidus due to lymphocytic infundibulo-neurohypophysitis, without performing invasive transsphenoidal pituitary biopsy.
63 	 This case suggested the usefulness of anti-rabphilin-3A antibodies for the etiological diagnosis of central diabetes insipidus during pregnancy.
64 	 We report herein a 27-year-old male case of inherited distal renal tubular acidosis complicated with renal diabetes insipidus, the symptoms of which were aggravated by the occurrence of diabetes mellitus.
65 	 At 2 months after birth, he was diagnosed as having inherited distal renal tubular acidosis and thereafter supplementation of both potassium and alkali was started to treat his hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis.
66 	 At the age of 4 years, calcification of the bilateral renal medulla was detected by computed tomography.
67 	 Subsequently his urinary volume gradually increased and polyuria of approximately 4 L/day persisted.
68 	 At the age of 27 years, he became fond of sugar-sweetened drinks and also often forgot to take the medicine.
69 	 He was admitted to our hospital due to polyuria of more than 10 L day, muscle weakness and gait disturbance.
70 	 Laboratory tests disclosed worsening of both hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis in addition to severe hyperglycemia.
71 	 It seemed likely that occurrence of diabetes mellitus and cessation of medications can induce osmotic diuresis and aggravate hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis.
72 	 Consequently, severe dehydration, hypokalemia-induced damage of his urinary concentration ability and enhancement of the renin angiotensin system occurred and thereby possibly worsened his hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis.
73 	 As normalization of hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis might have exacerbated hypokalemia further, dehydration and hypokalemia were treated first.
74 	 Following intensive treatment, these abnormalities were improved, but polyuria persisted.
75 	 Elevated plasma antidiuretic hormone (12.0 pg/mL) and deficit of renal responses to antidiuretic hormone suggested that the polyuria was attributable to the preexisting renal diabetes insipidus possibly caused by bilateral renal medulla calcification.
76 	 Thiazide diuretic or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were not effective for the treatment of diabetes insipidus in the present case.
77 	 Disruption of water and electrolyte balance is frequently encountered in clinical medicine.
78 	 Regulating water metabolism is critically important.
79 	 Diabetes insipidus (DI) presented with excessive water loss from the kidney is a major disorder of water metabolism.
80 	 To understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms and pathophysiology of DI and rationales of clinical management of DI is important for both research and clinical practice.
81 	 This chapter will first review various forms of DI focusing on central diabetes insipidus (CDI) and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI ) .
82 	 This is followed by a discussion of regulatory mechanisms underlying CDI and NDI , with a focus on the regulatory axis of vasopressin, vasopressin receptor 2 (V2R ) and the water channel molecule, aquaporin 2 (AQP2 ).
83 	 The clinical manifestation, diagnosis and management of various forms of DI will also be discussed with highlights of some of the latest therapeutic strategies that are developed from in vitro experiments and animal studies.
84 	 Deficiency of the antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) underlies diabetes insipidus, which is characterized by the excretion of abnormally large volumes of dilute urine and persistent thirst.
85 	 In this issue of the JCI, Shi et al.
86 	 report that Sel1L-Hrd1 ER-associated degradation (ERAD) is responsible for the clearance of misfolded pro-arginine vasopressin (proAVP) in the ER.
87 	 Additionally, mice with Sel1L deficiency, either globally or specifically within AVP-expressing neurons, developed central diabetes insipidus.
88 	 The results of this study demonstrate a role for ERAD in neuroendocrine cells and serve as a clinical example of the effect of misfolded ER proteins retrotranslocated through the membrane into the cytosol, where they are polyubiquitinated, extracted from the ER membrane, and degraded by the proteasome.
89 	 Moreover, proAVP misfolding in hereditary central diabetes insipidus likely shares common physiopathological mechanisms with proinsulin misfolding in hereditary diabetes mellitus of youth.
90 	 Autoimmune hypophysitis (AH) has a variable clinical presentation and natural history; likewise, its response to glucocorticoid therapy is often unpredictable.
91 	 Post operative complications after pituitary tumour surgery vary according to procedure.
92 	 There are several surgical procedures being done such as transcranial, transsphenoidal microsurgical and transsphenoidal endoscopic approaches.
93 	 One of the commonest complications is diabetes insipidus (DI).
94 	 Our main objective was to find out the incidence of diabetes insipidus in post operative period among patients undergoing surgical intervention for pituitary tumour in our institute.
95 	 The presence of diabetes insipidus in the postoperative period was established by measuring serum Na+ concentration, hourly urine output and urinary specific gravity to find out the incidence of diabetes insipidus in postoperative period in relation to age, gender, tumour diameter, function of tumour (i.e., either hormone secreting or not) and operative procedure used for surgical resection of pituitary tumor.
96 	 As it is the most common postoperative complication so, in this study we tried to find out how many of the patients develop diabetes insipidus in postoperative period following surgical resection of pituitary tumour.
97 	 This cross sectional type of observational study was carried out in the department of Neurosurgery, BSMMU from May 2014 to October 2015 on 33 consecutive patients who underwent surgical intervention for pituitary tumour for the first time.
98 	 Data was collected by using a data collection sheet.
99 	 The incidence of diabetes insipidus was found 23.1% of patients in <30 year age group, 38.5% of patients in 31-40 year age group and 38.5% of patients in ≥40 year age group (p=0.764).
100 	 In case of distribution of patients according to gender 38.5% of male and 61.5% of female developed diabetes insipidus (p=0.073).
101 	 Regarding tumour size 30.8% and 69.2% of patients developed diabetes insipidus having tumour diameter <30mm and ≥30mm respectively (p=0.590).
102 	 In case of operative procedure 69.2% of patients developed diabetes insipidus who was operated by transsphenoidal endoscopic approach, 23.1% and 7.7% of patients developed diabetes insipidus who underwent pituitary tumour resection through transsphenoidal microscopic approach and transcranial microscopic approach respectively (p=0.432).
103 	 17.6% of patients develop DI having functioning pituitary macroadenoma and 62.5% of patients develop DI having nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenoma.
104 	 This observational study has been performed to find out the incidence of diabetes insipidus.
105 	 Incidence of postoperative DI is more at or around the age of 40 years.
106 	 It is slightly predominant in female.
107 	 Most of the patients manifest DI in the first 24 hours of surgical intervention.
108 	 Incidence of DI is low among patients having functioning pituitary macroadenoma.
109 	 Adipsic diabetes insipidus is a rare complication of intracranial tumors in which impaired antidiuretic hormone secretion is associated with the loss of thirst sensation.
110 	 Here, we present the case of a patient with bifocal intracranial germinoma, diagnosed due to symptoms mainly caused by adipsic diabetes insipidus.
111 	 This is, to our knowledge, the first case of adipsic diabetes insipidus revealing an intracranial germinoma reported in the literature.
112 	 We describe the diagnostic procedures and the three-year follow-up of this patient.
113 	 Management of intracranial germ-cell tumors is made complex by the wide range of histological features.
114 	 Although germinomas have a generally better prognosis than most nongerminomatous tumors, they can have severe or even life-threatening presentations.
115 	 Adipsic diabetes insipidus is one such severe presentation and its rarity can make it difficult to recognize and manage.
116 	 Awareness of this potential entity is therefore important for clinical practice.
117 	 Autoimmune polyglandular syndromes are conditions characterized by the combination of two or more organ-specific disorders.
118 	 The underestimation oftheir real frequency probable results from physicians' inadequate knowledge of these clinical entities and sometimes their atypical clinical presentation.
119 	 Because they comprise a wide spectrum of autoimmune disorders, autoimmune polyglandular syndromes are divided into four types, among which type-3 is the most common one.
120 	 In this article, we report the case of a young female, initially diagnosed with diabetes mellitus who several years later developed full-blown autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 3 consisting of autoimmune thyroid disorder and latent autoimmune diabetes in adults.
121 	 The discussed case suggests that in selected patients diabetes insipidus may coexist with autoimmune endocrinopathies and nonendocrine autoimmunopathies, as well as that in some patients idiopathic diabetes insipidus may be secondary to lymphocytic infiltration and destruction of the hypothalamic supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei and/or the supraoptic-hypophyseal tract
122 	 When a patient with diabetes mellitus presents with worsening polyuria and polydipsia, what is a sensible, cost-effective approach?
123 	 We report the unique coincidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus.
124 	 A 46-year-old woman with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes complained of polyuria with a daily output of 5 L.
125 	 Although urinalysis demonstrated significant glucosuria, diabetes insipidus was suspected owing to a low urine specific gravity (1.008).
126 	 The low specific gravity persisted during a water deprivation test.
127 	 Ultimately, diabetes insipidus was confirmed when urine specific gravity and urine osmolality normalized following desmopressin administration.
128 	 This case emphasizes the importance of accurately interpreting the urine specific gravity in patients with polyuria and diabetes mellitus to detect diabetes insipidus.
129 	 An increasing number of women is surviving breast cancer and due to that at risk of developing an isolated ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) or a contralateral breast cancer (CBC).
130 	 Patients' main concern is cancer recurrence.
131 	 Patient counseling on breast cancer recurrence is challenging.
132 	 In order to provide healthcare professionals and patients more guidance, a systematic literature review of the incidence of isolated IBTR and CBC in women diagnosed with early invasive breast cancer was performed.
133 	 Medline, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library were searched from 2000 until October 2015.
134 	 Multicenter studies reporting an IBTR or CBC rate in curatively treated adult females diagnosed with invasive breast cancer were included.
135 	 The initial search yielded 6998 potentially relevant articles.
136 	 Twenty were eligible for inclusion, representing 25 recurrence incidence rates.
137 	 Both isolated IBTR and CBC incidence rates steadily increased with the length of follow-up, indicating that IBTR and CBC occur even more than 15 years after diagnosis.
138 	 The annual incidence rate of isolated IBTR and CBC in women diagnosed with an early invasive breast cancer was 0.6% (range: 0.4-1.1%) and 0.5% (range: 0.2-0.7%), respectively.
139 	 Analyzed data were lacking information about important risk factors and given treatment with regard to the incidence of recurrence, which hampers the prediction of patient tailored recurrence risks.
140 	 The presented rates are therefore the best available estimates of isolated IBTR and CBC annual incidence rates based on the current literature.
141 	 Healthcare professionals could use these rates in their communication with patients diagnosed with early invasive breast cancer.
142 	 pN stage and breast cancer subtypes (BCS) are both well-recognized prognostic indicators.
143 	 Our previous work has highlighted that patients even with the same pN stage exhibited a significant survival difference in different BCS.
144 	 Given this achievement, we hypothesized that a statistical interaction might exist between pN stage and BCS.
145 	 The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to compare the prognostic value of the combined pN stage and BCS (pN<sub
146 	 >new</sub> stage) with either pN stage or BCS alone, and to determine if this combined new stage could serve as an alternative discriminator of outcome.
147 	 Data on treatment and outcome of advanced breast cancer in routine practice are rare, especially concerning recurrent disease, but important to complement the results from clinical trials and to improve the standard of care.
148 	 We present data on choice of systemic first-line treatment, number of treatment lines, and survival of patients treated by medical oncologists in Germany.
149 	 1395 patients recruited by 124 sites at start of first-line therapy into the ongoing, prospective German clinical cohort study TMK (Tumour Registry Breast Cancer) between February 2007 and October 2015 were analysed.
150 	 The median OS was 33.8 months (95% CI 30.2-40.2) for HR-positive/HER2-negative, 38.2 months (95% CI 31.3-43.0) for HER2-positive and 16.8 months (95% CI 11.5-22.0) for triple negative breast cancer.
151 	 Patients with triple negative tumours more often died before start of a third-line therapy than patients with HR-positive or HER2-positive tumours (44% vs. 25%).
152 	 Use of taxane-based chemotherapies has increased since 2007, with 65% of all first-line chemotherapy-treatments containing taxanes in 2013-15 (60% HR-positive/HER2-negative, 75% HER2-positive, 56% triple negative).
153 	 52% of the patients with HR-positive/HER2-negative tumours received first-line endocrine therapy in 2013-15; when restricted to patients with only non-visceral metastases this percentage increased to 63%.
154 	 To our knowledge, this is the first cohort study showing systemic first-line therapy for all subtypes of advanced breast cancer.
155 	 Overall survival in the TMK is comparable to that reported by clinical trials despite the inclusion of older and comorbid patients.
156 	 Amplification of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) gene is associated with worse prognosis and decreased overall survival in breast cancer patients.
157 	 The HER2 gene contains several polymorphisms; two of the best-characterized HER2 polymorphisms are Ile655Val and Ala1170Pro.
158 	 The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between these two HER2 polymorphisms in normal breast and breast cancer tissues and known breast cancer prognostic factors in a retrospective cohort study of 73 women with non-metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer.
159 	 HER2 polymorphisms were assessed in breast cancer tissue and normal breast tissue using TaqMan assay.
160 	 Ala1170Pro polymorphism in normal breast tissue was associated with age at diagnosis (p = 0.007), tumor size (p = 0.004) and lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.06).
161 	 Similar significant associations in cancer tissues were observed.
162 	 No association between the Ile655Val polymorphism and prognostic factors were observed.
163 	 However, we found significant differences in the distribution of Ile655Val (p = 0.03) and Ala1170Pro (p = 0.01) genotypes between normal breast and breast tumor tissues.
164 	 This study demonstrates that only the Ala1170Pro polymorphism is associated with prognostic factors in HER2-positive breast cancer patients.
165 	 Moreover, our results suggest that both HER2 polymorphisms could play a significant role in carcinogenesis in non-metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer women.
166 	 Health-related quality of life and utility scores of patients with breast cancer and precancerous lesions are sparse in China.
167 	 This study aimed to derive utility scores of patients with breast cancer and precancer in China.
168 	 Since 1998, the Ontario Breast Screening Program (OBSP) has offered organized assessment through Breast Assessment Centres (BAC).
169 	 This study compares survival between screened women diagnosed with breast cancer who have undergone assessment through a BAC and usual care (UC).
170 	 We conducted a retrospective study to assess the follow-up of patients with localized breast cancer and the first indicators of advanced breast cancer recurrence.
171 	 All patients with advanced breast cancer recurrence treated between January 2010 and June 2016 in our institution were registered.
172 	 Among these patients, 303 patients initially treated for early breast cancer with curative intent were identified.
173 	 After initial curative treatment, follow-up involved the oncologist, the general practitioner and the gynecologist in 68.0%, 48.9% and 19.1% of cases, respectively.
174 	 The median DFI was 4 years for luminal A, 3.8 years for luminal B, 3.7 years for HER2-positive and 1.5 years for TNBC (p = 0.07).
175 	 Breast cancer tumor marker was prescribed for 164 patients (54.1%).
176 	 No difference in terms of follow-up was observed according to the molecular subtype.
177 	 Symptoms were the primary indicator of relapse for 143 patients (47.2%).
178 	 Breast cancer recurrence was discovered by CA 15.3 elevation in 57 patients (18.8%) and by CAE elevation in 3 patients (1%).
179 	 The rate of relapse diagnosed by elevation of CA 15.3 or CAE was not statistically associated with the molecular subtype (p = 0.65).
180 	 Luminal A cases showed a significantly higher rate of bone metastases (p = 0.0003).
181 	 TNBC cases showed a significantly higher rate of local recurrence (p = 0.002) and a borderline statistical significant higher rate of lung/pleural metastases (p = 0.07).
182 	 Follow-up recommendations could be adapted in clinical practice according to the molecular subtype.
183 	 General practitioners should be more involved by the specialists in breast cancer follow-up.
184 	 Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to play crucial roles in breast cancer.
185 	 This study aimed to determine the clinical significance and biological functions of lncRNA AFAP1-AS1 in breast cancer.
186 	 To investigate overall and breast cancer-specific mortality in early-stage breast cancer patients with and without schizophrenia or related disorders.
187 	 To study the impact of subtypes and comorbidities on breast cancer (BC) relapse and survival in the heterogeneous patients of the real world.
188 	 In 2017, breast cancer became the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women in the US.
189 	 After lung cancer, breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in women.
190 	 The breast consists of several components, including milk storage glands, milk ducts made of epithelial cells, adipose tissue, and stromal tissue.
191 	 Mammographic density (MD) is based on the proportion of stromal, epithelial, and adipose tissue.
192 	 Women with high MD have more stromal and epithelial cells and less fatty adipose tissue, and are more likely to develop breast cancer in their lifetime compared to women with low MD.
193 	 Because of this correlation, high MD is an independent risk factor for breast cancer.
194 	 Further, mammographic screening is less effective in detecting suspicious lesions in dense breast tissue, which can lead to late-stage diagnosis.
195 	 Molecular differences between dense and non-dense breast tissues explain the underlying biological reasons for why women with dense breasts are at a higher risk for developing breast cancer.
196 	 The goal of this review is to highlight the current molecular understanding of MD, its association with breast cancer risk, the demographics pertaining to MD, and the environmental factors that modulate MD.
197 	 Finally, we will review the current legislation regarding the disclosure of MD on a traditional screening mammogram and the supplemental screening options available to women with dense breast tissue.
198 	 The genotype of Fanconi Anemia complementation group M (FANCM) was previously found to be associated with breast cancer risk in several populations.
199 	 Here, we studied the expression of FANCM and its correlation with clinical characteristics in Chinese patients with breast cancer.
200 	 Breast cancer, the most common invasive cancer and cause of cancer-related death in women worldwide, is a multifactorial, complex disease, and many molecular players and mechanisms underlying the complexity of its clinical behavior remain unknown.
201 	 To investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) in combination with pertuzumab in Japanese patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer.
202 	 To assess risks of secondary malignancies in breast cancer patients who received radiation therapy compared to patients who did not.
203 	 This is the first systematic review to investigate the risk of recurrence in breast cancer survivors <50 years old who have used hormone replacement therapy (HRT).
204 	 Developments in breast cancer biology over the last years have permitted deconstructing the molecular profile of the most relevant breast cancer subtypes.
205 	 This has led to an increase in therapeutic options, including more effective personalized therapy for breast cancer and substantial improvements in patient outcomes.
206 	 Although currently there are only a few targeted therapies approved for metastatic breast cancer, the discovery of druggable kinase gene alterations has radically changed cancer treatment by providing novel and successfully actionable drug targets.
207 	 Fibroblast growth factors and their receptors (FGFRs) participate in different physiologic processes and also play an essential role in cancer cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis.
208 	 This article summarizes the main molecular alterations of FGFRs, as well as the available preclinical and clinical data with FGFR inhibitors in breast cancer, and discusses new opportunities for the clinical development of these agents in patients with breast cancer.
209 	 Previous research has reported associations between social relationships and carcinogenesis.
210 	 Inflammation is a potential mediator of these associations.
211 	 To clarify these links for one tumor site, we examined associations between social relationships, circulating inflammation markers, and breast cancer incidence.
212 	 The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential correlation between lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and their clinicopathologic significance in breast cancer.
213 	 There are three main ways in which women can be identified as being at high risk of breast cancer i) family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer, which includes genetic factors ii) mammographically identified high breast density, and iii) certain types of benign breast disease.
214 	 The last category is the least common, but in some ways the easiest one for which treatment can be offered, because these women have already entered into the treatment system.
215 	 The highest risk is seen in women with lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), but this is very rare.
216 	 More common is atypical hyperplasia (AH), which carries a 4-5-fold risk of breast cancer as compared to general population.
217 	 Even more common is hyperplasia of the usual type and carries a roughly two-fold increased risk.
218 	 Women with aspirated cysts are also at increased risk of subsequent breast cancer.
219 	 Tamoxifen has been shown to be particularly effective in preventing subsequent breast cancer in women with AH, with a more than 70% reduction in the P1 trial and a 60% reduction in IBIS-I.
220 	 The aromatase inhibitors (AIs) also are highly effective for AH and LCIS.
221 	 There are no published data on the effectiveness of tamoxifen or the AIs for breast cancer prevention in women with hyperplasia of the usual type, or for women with aspirated cysts.
222 	 Improving diagnostic consistency, breast cancer risk prediction and education of physicians and patients regarding therapeutic prevention in women with benign breast disease may strengthen breast cancer prevention efforts.
