Despite its well-known cardiotoxicity, the anthracyclin doxorubicin (DOX) continues to be an effective and widely used chemotherapeutic agent. DOX-induced cardiac damage presumably results from the formation of free radicals by DOX. Reactive oxygen species particularly affect the cardiac myocytes because these cells seem to have a relatively poor antioxidant defense system. The semisynthetic flavonoid monohydroxyethylrutoside (monoHER) showed cardioprotection against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity through its radical scavenging and iron chelating properties. Because of the relatively short final half-life of monoHER (about 30 min), it is expected that the time interval between monoHER and DOX might be of influence on the cardioprotective effect of monoHER. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate this possible effect.
