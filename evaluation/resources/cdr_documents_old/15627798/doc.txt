Animals treated with gentamicin can show residual areas of interstitial fibrosis in the renal cortex. This study investigated the expression of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases and macrophages in the renal cortex and structural and functional renal changes of rats treated with gentamicin or gentamicin + pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), an NF-kappaB inhibitor.
