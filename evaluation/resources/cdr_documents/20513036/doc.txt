Botulinum toxin (Botox) injections into the thyroarytenoid muscles are the current standard of care for adductor spasmodic dysphonia (ADSD). Reported adverse effects include a period of breathiness, throat pain, and difficulty with swallowing liquids. Here we report multiple cases of bilateral abductor paralysis following Botox injections for ADSD, a complication previously unreported.
