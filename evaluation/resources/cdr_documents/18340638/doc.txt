Azathioprine is widely used as an immunosuppressive drug. The side effects of azathioprine include anemia, which has been attributed to bone marrow suppression. Alternatively, anemia could result from accelerated suicidal erythrocyte death or eryptosis, which is characterized by exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) at the erythrocyte surface and by cell shrinkage.
