Signalling through the insulin receptor

The insulin receptor substrates function at the heart of the
insulin signalling network. It has recently become apparent that
the intracellular localisation of these molecules is regulated in a
precise manner that is critical for both the generation and the
termination of the insulin signal. Some insulin receptor
substrate isoforms appear to be associated with an insoluble
matrix that resembles the cytoskeleton. When inappropriately
dissociated from this matrix the signalling network collapses
concomitant with loss of insulin sensitivity.

Introduction
Unlike other growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases
(GF-RTKs), the insulin receptor (IR) utilises a family of soluble adaptors or scaffolding molecules, known as insulin
receptor substrates (IRSs), to initiate its signalling programme. Whilst most GF-RTKs regulate long-term events
such as cell differentiation and mitogenesis, a major function
of the IR is the acute regulation of glucose metabolism in
muscle and fat cells. It has been proposed that IRS proteins
have evolved to facilitate this unique aspect of insulin action.
Numerous tyrosine phosphorylation sites on IRSs act as
docking sites for Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing
signalling molecules, indicating that IRSs represent the
epicentre for the majority of IR downstream signalling
events involved in insulin action [1]. One key molecule
that is activated in this manner is phosphoinositide

3-kinase (PI3K), a lipid kinase that generates phosphorylated phosphatidylinositol (PI) intermediates (such as PI
3,4,5-triphosphate, PIP3) in the cytosolic leaflet of cellular
membranes [2]. These PIP3 intermediates recruit other
downstream signalling molecules particularly serine/threonine protein kinases such as Akt and atypical protein
kinase C (PKC) isoforms to membranes. Membrane
recruitment of these molecules facilitates their interaction
with upstream regulators, including the serine kinase 3phosphoinositide-dependent-kinase 1 (PDK1), which
phosphorylate and activate them [3]. This relatively simple mechanism of membrane microlocalisation is a
unifying theme in signal transduction.
As simple as the above mechanism seems, several observations imply the existence of further layers of complexity.
While considerable evidence has accrued to implicate
PI3K/Akt in insulin action, other GFs that are equally effective in activating PI3K are metabolically incompetent.
Furthermore, as discussed in other articles in this issue,
most biological membranes including the plasma membrane, the presumed site of Akt activation, are now viewed
as composites of lipid microdomains that may define ‘signalling hotspots’ where the concentrated assembly of
signalling molecules may be a key element in signalling
specificity. Overexpression of signalling molecules, including IRS proteins [4,5], in some cases causes constitutive
activation and more potent phenotypes are often observed if
soluble signalling molecules become permanently associated with membranes; in fact, Akt becomes transforming
under these conditions [6]. To begin to tease this aspect of
signalling apart, it is essential not to perturb the endogenous
balance. Further downstream we encounter other layers of
complexity. Once activated at the plasma membrane, how
do signalling molecules find their way to their correct site of
action? This is a key question given that numerous GFs activate PI3K/Akt to evoke specific responses, including
apoptosis, protein translation, differentiation and glucose
metabolism. Presumably, this requires that activated Akt
seeks out downstream targets in discrete locations such as
the nucleus, on the mitochondrial surface or in the cytoplasm [7]. However, it is not clear if this process is random
or highly organised. What role do IRS proteins play in this
and other aspects of insulin signalling?
Previous studies have suggested that IRS proteins may be
localized to the cytoskeleton and that this localization is
regulated. In this review we consider the evidence to support the cytoskeletal association of IRS and discuss the
physiological consequence of this localization. A model is
presented to suggest that this may prevent IRS from targeted degradation and thus play an important role in
insulin sensitivity.

Insulin receptor substrates
To date, four IRS proteins have been identified (denoted
IRS-1 to IRS-4), all having a conserved domain structure,
including pleckstrin homology (PH) and phosphotyrosinebinding (PTB) domains at the amino terminus that are
required for efficient coupling to the IR. The PTB domain
binds directly to the juxtamembrane region of the IR (at
the NPXY motif) and this is thought to be enhanced by
interactions of the PH domain with membrane phospholipids or intracellular proteins [8–11,12••]. The
carboxy-terminal domain is poorly conserved except for the
presence of multiple motifs that become tyrosine phosphorylated in response to insulin, and these serve as docking
sites for SH2 domain-containing proteins such as PI3K,
SH2-containing phosphotyrosine phosphatase (SHP2) and
Grb2. Some of these sites are unique, raising the possibility that they may be involved in specific processes.
While there is considerable evidence for a direct role of
IRS-1 and IRS-2 in insulin’s metabolic actions [1], the role
of IRS-3 or IRS-4 is less clear, despite the fact that overexpression of these proteins in adipocytes mimic some of
insulin’s actions [5]: IRS-4 is undetectable in muscle or
adipocytes [13], and IRS-3, which undergoes insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation in adipocytes, does not
appear to bind significant levels of PI3K in response to
insulin [14]. In addition, IRS-3–/– mice exhibit normal glucose tolerance [15]. Conversely, both IRS-1 and IRS-2 are
major insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphoproteins in
adipocytes and muscle cells and IRS-1–/– and IRS-2–/–
mice both display insulin resistance [16,17,18•].
From an evolutionary standpoint, increasing complexity of
organisms could dictate the development of more sophisticated systems to allow coordination of intricate
physiological events. Invertebrates such as Drosophila and
Caenorhabditis elegans have an insulin-like signalling pathway similar to that in mammals [19,20], which appears to
regulate growth and metabolism [19–22]. Whilst many of
the downstream signalling molecules are conserved, such
as PI3K and Akt, it is noteworthy that both the Drosophila
and C. elegans IR homologues contain a carboxy-terminal
extension reminiscent of IRS-1, which contains putative
docking sites for PI3K and SHP2 [21–24]. However, only a
single homologue of IRS, termed CHICO, has been identified in Drosophila and no IRS homologues have currently
been identified in C. elegans. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the IRS proteins have evolved as a family of
molecules distinct from the IR family to afford higher
organisms greater flexibility to coordinate multiple events.
We would like to consider the possibilities in favour of this
with regard to different aspects of insulin action.

Role of insulin receptor substrates in signal
generation
To enable the acute regulation of the insulin signalling
network, phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2 by the IR
must occur rapidly. Because IRS proteins are soluble

223

molecules, however, it is unclear how and where they
intersect with the membrane-associated IR. The requirement for IR internalisation in promoting IRS tyrosine
phosphorylation has been the subject of several studies.
Inhibition of internalisation by incubation of cells at 4°C
has produced evidence for and against a need for this
process [25,26]. Similarly, studies using dominant interfering dynamin mutants suggest that internalisation is not
required [27•]. However, IR internalisation was not completely inhibited in these studies and, given the catalytic
nature of the signal generated, it is conceivable that only a
small amount of internalised IR is necessary to stimulate
IRS tyrosine phosphorylation.
In determining the site of coupling between IRS and the
IR, the intracellular location of IRS-1/2 is of considerable
interest. Kelly and Ruderman [28] first showed, by crude
fractionation, that IRS-1 is highly enriched in an intracellular fraction referred to as either the low-density microsomes
or high-speed pellet (HSP). Notably, the IR is not enriched
in this fraction [26,28]. More recently, IRS-2 has been
shown to be enriched in this fraction [14,29••–31••]. This
appears to represent the active component of IRS-1/2
because HSP-associated IRS-1/2 is rapidly and highly tyrosine phosphorylated in response to insulin treatment of
cells, leading to a specific increase in PI3K in this fraction.
Conversely, there is little or no recruitment of PI3K to fractions containing the tyrosine phosphorylated IR
[26,29••,30••]. Biochemical studies have since indicated
that IRS-1/2 co-sediment with the HSP fraction not
because of their association with membranes but rather
because of their association with large polypeptide complexes — possibly the cytoskeleton [30••,31••,32].
Most membranes are coated with cytoskeletal elements
and in certain cells  platelets, for example — membrane
skeletons are attached to the underside of the plasma
membrane and act as a conduit between the external and
the internal environment [33]. Indeed, filamentous structures running beneath the plasma membrane of adipocytes
have been described [34]. Alternatively, the cytoskeleton
in adipocytes may form an array that interacts with the
plasma membrane at its multiple end points. Insulin may
regulate this interaction in a manner analogous to the formation of focal adhesions. Thus, IRS-1/2 may slide along
the filaments that make up this array and transiently interact with the membrane, possibly via PH domain
interactions, so increasing the efficiency of coupling with
the IR (see Figure 1). This model also provides a potential
means for the deposition of other molecules, including
PI3K/Akt, to various intracellular sites such as the mitochondrial and nuclear membranes. A completely different
model, which also cannot be ruled out at the present time,
is that IRS-1/2 binds to a large polypeptide complex distinct from the cytoskeleton that sediments with the HSP
and this complex may associate with the IR in a regulated
manner. One candidate proposed by Czech and colleagues
[35] is the adaptor protein 3 (AP3) complex. They have

Model illustrating the putative role of cytoskeleton-associated IRS-1/2
in IR signalling. (a) In the basal state (i.e. in the absence of insulin),
IRS-1/2 are associated with the cytoskeleton, which may run parallel to
the membrane as shown, or may form arrays interacting with the plasma
membrane at multiple points. The association of IRS-1/2 with the
cytoskeleton maintains the signalling apparatus in a ‘primed’ fashion.
(b) Upon insulin stimulation, the IR undergoes tyrosine
autophosphorylation. Interaction of IRS-1/2 with the tyrosine
phosphorylated cytoplasmic tail of the IR is facilitated by the
cytoskeleton and mediated by interaction of the PH/PTB domain.
Following tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1/2 on key sites, SH2domain-containing proteins such as PI3K are recruited. (c) The
cytoskeleton targets the activated IRS-1/2–PI3K complex to specific
microdomains within the plasma membrane. PIP3 is generated at these
specific sites, serving to recruit PDK1 (and PDK2) and downstream
kinases such as Akt2 (in adipocytes) and the atypical PKCs (ζ/λ).
PDK1 mediates their activation by phosphorylation. Activated Akt2 and
PKC (ζ/λ) then translocate to alternative sites, possibly via the
cytoskeletal network, to phosphorylate downstream effectors and so
coordinate glucose metabolism. (d) Following chronic insulin treatment
(as in states of hyperinsulinemia) or other regimes such as okadaic acid
treatment, IRS-1/2 become hyperphosphorylated on serine residues.
This is coupled with dissociation from the cytoskeleton, which also
undergoes serine phosphorylation, preventing the interaction of IRS-1/2
with the IR. Cytosolic IRS-1/2 may then be targeted for degradation by
intracellular proteases such as the proteasome.

suggested that IRS-1/2 may associate with the IR in
clathrin-coated pits at the cell surface [26]. However, there
is no evidence that AP3 adaptors regulate the formation of
clathrin-coated pits at the cell surface, thus further emphasising the need to re-investigate the need for IR
internalisation in IRS phosphorylation.
An additional advantage of anchoring IRS-1/2 proteins to
the cytoskeleton is that this may create a scaffold for
attracting other downstream molecules, such as PI3K/Akt,
and then provide a very controlled way of delivering these
molecules to their appropriate site of action. The
cytoskeleton is known to undergo major rearrangements as
cells traverse the cell cycle or as preadipocytes differentiate into adipocytes. Hence, one could imagine that a major
purpose of such rearrangements might be to create new or
different destinations for signalling molecules, thus ensuring that they do the right thing at the right time. Attempts
to localise the site of PI3K activity in living cells using a
PIP3-specific binding protein (ARNO) linked to green fluorescence protein (GFP), suggested that insulin activates
PI3K primarily at the plasma membrane [36•].

Current Opinion in Cell Biology

Consistent with this, Akt undergoes translocation to the plasma membrane [37,38,39•]. How can these observations be
reconciled with the fact that other GFs such as plateletderived GF (PDGF) recruit and activate PI3K at the plasma
membrane in adipocytes, yet the majority of evidence suggests they are metabolically incompetent [40–42]? First,
fractionation studies indicate that the majority of insulin-stimulated IRS-associated PI3K activity resides in the HSP,
whereas PDGF activates PI3K in the plasma membrane. Second, direct measurement of PIP3 levels in intact adipocytes

CBC207.QXD

suggests that PDGF has very little effect on the production of
these lipids [43]. Third, PDGF is not equally effective in activating Akt [39•,44,45,46•]. Nevertheless, PDGF generates a
signal that is sufficient to stimulate other PI3K-dependent
pathways, such as p70S6K and PHAS-1, in these cells [46•].
Collectively, these findings indicate that IRS-1/2-mediated
activation of PI3K is qualitatively different to that mediated by
direct association with the PDGF receptor. One model that
may account for these differences is that the PDGF receptor
and IRS-1/2 recruit PI3K to distinct plasma membrane
microdomains with unique lipid compositions including PIP3.
Alternatively, IRS-1/2 may also regulate PI3K/Akt at more
remote locations in the cell that are inaccessible to the PDGF
receptor. It also remains conceivable that PDGF activates only
the serine protein kinase activity of PI3K in intact cells. Whilst
this activity may be sufficient to activate p70S6K and PHAS1, as has been shown for mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK), it may be insufficient to activate Akt [47].
An additional issue is one of isoform specificity. Recent
studies suggest that the expression of Akt2 is induced in
adipocytes at the expense of Akt1 [39•,46•]. Moreover,
there are several different isoforms of both the regulatory
and catalytic subunits of PI3K [2] and it remains possible
that different isoforms of PI3K may couple uniquely to different Akt isoforms.

Role of insulin receptor substrates in
desensitisation
In addition to stimulating IRS tyrosine phosphorylation, insulin also causes increased serine/threonine
phosphorylation of IRS-1, which is thought to cause conformational changes, making it a poor substrate for the IR [48].
Several serine/threonine kinases that are regulated by insulin
have since been implicated in mediating this effect, including PI3K [49], Akt [50], MAPK [50,51] and GSK3 [52,53],
thus providing a possible mechanism for signal termination.
Serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRSs also appears
concomitant with IRS dissociation from the HSP, leading
to the suggestion that these events may be linked [26].
However, it has since been found that IRS dissociation
from the HSP may be uncoupled from IRS serine/threonine phosphorylation [31••] and that serine/threonine
phosphorylation of components other than IRSs are
accountable for this effect [29••]. In keeping with the
model that a HSP cytoskeletal matrix interacts with IRS1/2, the serine kinase ROKα constitutes a suitable
candidate for regulating this effect. ROKα binds to IRS-1
and has been further implicated in the disassembly of the
cytoskeleton [54,55]. Disassembly of the cytoskeleton provides a second potential mechanism for signal termination
by disengaging IRS from its access to IR.

Role of insulin receptor substrates in crosstalk and insulin resistance
As mentioned earlier, the evolution of higher organisms
called for the development of complex hormonal systems

225

for the regulation of various events, including cell proliferation, division and metabolism. The cell must therefore
assimilate a myriad of different signals in order to mediate
an appropriate response. Whilst integration may occur at
many levels, the IRS proteins are ideally positioned to combine signals from multiple receptors. As such, several factors
including growth hormone, catecholamines and tumour
necrosis factor α (TNFα) are known to impact on insulin
action and insulin signalling. In many cases, they appear to
do so at an early signalling step between insulin binding and
PI3K activity, namely at the level of the IRS [48,56,57].
There is also substantial evidence to suggest that at least
some forms of insulin resistance may operate at the level of
the IRS. TNFα [48,57], okadaic acid [58] or chronic insulin
treatment [59,60] all increase serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRSs and induce insulin-resistant states. Indeed,
increased IRS serine kinase activity has recently been
detected in diabetic states [61••]. Consistent with the
above mechanisms for signal termination described above,
we have found that chronic insulin or okadaic acid treatments result in quantitative dissociation of the IRS from
the HSP [31••]. Moreover, oxidative stress has been reported to promote insulin resistance by disruption of the
intracellular distribution of IRS-1 [62••]. Dissociation of
IRS from the HSP may also provide a rational basis for the
observed decrease in total intracellular IRS upon chronic
insulin treatment. Release of IRS into the cytosol coincides
with this decrease in IRS [31••], and may thereby facilitate
greater IRS accessibility to proteases such as the proteasome [63•]. As such, reduced IRS protein levels have been
reported in many states of insulin resistance.

Conclusions
The involvement of IRS-1/2 appears to be central to the
unique ability of the IR to regulate events such as glucose
metabolism. Although we do not yet have definitive proof,
data suggest that the recruitment and activation of signal
transduction molecules such as PI3K to specific membranous
microdomains is at least partly responsible. Approaches such as
immunoelectron microscopy should provide further insight
into the location of IRS-1/2 and the cytoskeleton in adipocytes.
Furthermore, identification of the proteins in the HSP that
interact with IRS-1/2, and subsequent characterisation of
the domains responsible for this interaction, will increase
our understanding of how these processes are regulated.
Whilst the role of PI3K in mediating the majority of insulin’s
effects is unequivocal, the requirement for additional pathways still remains contentious. PIP3 is seemingly
insufficient for insulin action, making a strong case for the
involvement of parallel pathways or the involvement of
another PI3K activity [64••]. Recent evidence appears to
have clarified the importance of Akt in insulin-stimulated
glucose uptake and highlighted the significance of considering isoform specificity [39•,46•,65••]. Additionally, there is a
growing body of evidence implicating the atypical PKCs
(ζ/λ) in mediating insulin-stimulated glucose uptake via a

pathway that appears to run parallel to that of Akt [66•–68•].
An important step will involve the identification and characterisation of potential downstream effectors.

Update
Since the submission of this review two interesting papers
have been published [69•,70•]. Oatey et al. [69•] used
GFP-tagged PIP3-binding proteins to show that insulin
stimulates PIP3 production at the plasma membrane to a
greater extent and in more cells than PDGF, consistent
with the findings in [43]. Fantin et al. [70•] have confirmed
that IRS-4 does not play a major role in the overall
response to insulin. However, the authors speculate that
the differences between IRS-4–/– and wild-type mice may
be due to alterations in hypothalamic function.

In agreement with Heller-Harrison et al. [26], inhibition of endocytosis using
a dominant interfering mutant of dynamin (K44A/dynamin) had little effect on
IRS-1 phosphorylation. Intriguingly however, insulin-stimulated recruitment
of PI3K to IRS-1- and IRS-1-associated PI3K activity was decreased.

the LDM/HSP by different mechanisms.

Inhibition of Akt activity, by microinjection of an Akt substrate peptide or Akt

isoform expression was altered upon differentiation of preadipocytes to
adipocytes and this was mirrored by a change in growth factor response
from platelet-derived growth factor to insulin.

Membrane-permeable esters of PIP3 were found to be insufficient to stimulate glucose uptake in adipocytes, but were able to restore glucose uptake
in insulin stimulated cells treated with wortmannin. These results provide
strong evidence for the requirement of a pathway independent of PIP3 for
full insulin stimulated glucose uptake.

between IRS-4–/– and wild-type mice may be due to alterations in hypothalamic function, where high levels of IRS-4 mRNA have been detected.
